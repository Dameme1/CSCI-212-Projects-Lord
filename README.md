# Java Projects - Kenneth Lord

In this repository, I will be showcasing my take on the projects assigned in CSCI 212 - Object Oriented Programming in Java

The goal here is to showcase and overview my dive into OOP Java with various different projects that build upon each other each iteration

*⚠️⚠️If you are a current student of Kenneth Lord, use this at your own risk⚠️⚠️*

*The projects assigned in CSCI 212 and CSCI 211 are of high importance as they create the foundation you need to be successful in the tech field, if you choose to merely copy paste the code without putting in the effort and learning it, you will not excel very well in the field*
